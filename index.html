				He was a boy
				She was a girl
				Can I make it any more obvious
				He was a punk
				She did ballet
				What more can I say
				He wanted her
				She'd never tell secretly she wanted him as well
				But all of her friends
				Stuck up their nose
				They had a problem with his baggy clothes
				He was a skater boy
				She said see you later boy
				He wasn't good enough for her
				She had a pretty face
				But her head was up in space
				She needed to come back down to earth
				Five years from now
				She sits at home
				Feeding the baby she's all alone
				She turns on t.v
				Guess who she sees
				Skater boy rockin' up MTV
				She calls up her friends
				They already know
				And they've all got
				Tickets to see his show
				She tags along
				Stands in the crowd
				Looks up at the man that she turned down.
